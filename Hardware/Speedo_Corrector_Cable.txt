Speedometer Corrector Cable
---------------------------

The 4-wire cable from the Speedo Corrector should use four different colors of
wire for easy identification, and should be stranded 18 to 20 gauge.

You can splice the cable into the wiring under the hood, or into the wiring
over the transmission / transfer case. If you splice it in, you'll have to tee
the +5V and GND wires, and you'll have to cut the signal wire. The wire from
the sensor goes to the input of the Speed Corrector, and the output goes to the
wire leading to the vehicle computer. A 4-pin waterproof automotive connector
should be used to make it easy to remove the Speedo Corrector if needed.

Alternatively, you can use a pair of matching 3-pin automotive connectors to
snap into the cable at the vehicle speed sensor. This way you do not have to
cut into the vehicle wiring.

See the "Jeep" folder for drawings.

The Speedo Corrector may be mounted under the hood, or inside the cab.
