Jeep Wrangler TJ (1997-2006) - Speedometer Wiring
-------------------------------------------------

This Speedometer Corrector was originally intended for a 2005 Jeep TJ. It may
work on other vehicles as-is, or it may need some tweaks.

As far as I can determine, all years of Jeep TJs use the same VSS (Vehicle
Speed Sensor), except for Rubicons, and possibly early 1997 models. And I
believe they all use the same connectors at the VSS (Rubi and non-Rubi) and
the same signals.

The wire colors vary by year.

This is what I was able to collect from the FSMs (Factory Service Manual),
listing circuit name, wire gauge, wire color, by year:

1997, 1998, 1999, 2000
  FSM pg 8W-80-21 (1997) and 8W-30-12 (1998) and 8W-30-10 (1999) and 8W-80-38
    (1998) and 8W-80-39 (1999), FSM pg 8W-30-10, 11, 8W-80-42 (2000)
  Pin 3 = Vehicle Speed Sensor Signal from sensor to PCM = G7 18 or 20 WT/OR
  Pin 2 = Ground from PCM = K167 20 BR/YL
  Pin 1 = 5 Volt Supply from PCM = K6 18 or 20 VT/OR

2001, 2002
  FSM pg 8W-30-10 and 8W-30-11 and 8W-80-45 (2001) and 8W-80-40 (2002)
  Pin 3 = Vehicle Speed Sensor Signal from sensor to PCM = G7 20 WT/OR
  Pin 2 = Ground from PCM = K4 20 BK/LB
  Pin 1 = 5 Volt Supply from PCM = K6 20 VT/OR

2003, 2004
  FSM pg 8W-30-10 and 8W-30-16 and 8W-80-50 (2003) and 8W-80-53 (2004)
  Pin 3 = Vehicle Speed Sensor Signal from sensor to PCM = G7 18 or 20 WT/OR
  Pin 2 = Ground from PCM = K4 20 BK/LB
  Pin 1 = 5 Volt Supply from PCM = K6 18 or 20 VT/WT

2005, 2006
  FSM pg 8W-30-10 and 8W-30-15 and 8W-80-55 (2005) and 8W-80-59 (2006)
  Pin 3 = Vehicle Speed Sensor Signal from sensor to PCM = K75 18 DB/OR
  Pin 2 = Ground from PCM = K900 20 DB/DG
  Pin 1 = 5 Volt Supply from PCM = F856 20 YL/PK

You can splice into the wiring in the big cables at the firewall, or you can
splice into the small cables over the transmission / transfer case. Or you can
make a cable with a male and female connector to insert into the circuit at the
Vehicle Speed Sensor, without cutting any vehicle wires.

The Speedometer Corrector will need +5V and GND from the vehicle wiring. The
Jeep TJ computer supplies regulated +5V to the VSS. Warning: Other vehicles may
not provide the correct voltage. You'll have to run the +5V and GND wires from
the Speedo Corrector to tee onto the appropriate wires.

The VSS signal wire must be cut (unless you're using connectors to insert your
wiring). The signal wire from the VSS goes to the input of the Speedometer
Corrector, and the output from the Speedometer Corrector goes to the signal
wire up to the computer (PCM/ECM).

The drawing "Speedo_Sensor_Wires.gif" shows a simple diagram of the Jeep
wiring, and how to splice in the Speedometer Corrector wires.

The drawing "Speedo_Corrector_Cable.gif" shows how to wire a cable with
automotive connectors, at the VSS, if you want to do it this way.
